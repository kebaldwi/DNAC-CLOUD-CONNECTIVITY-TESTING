# DNAC-CLOUD-CONNECTIVITY-TESTING

This code uses python to help with installations of DNAC Clusters in Enterprise networks and lab environments. Additionally, provides a cloud connectivity report and lets you know whether the cloud connectivity is failing because of one of the following reasons:

1. NTP
2. DNS Resolution
3. IP reachability
4. Proxy Filtering
5. Firewall Filtering
6. DNS Filtering

To run this code, you will need an instance of Cisco DNA Center and a python environment running 2.7 which is installed by default on MAC OS. You will need to install pip, and the Crypto and Paramiko modules.
